    text: 'The locking period for SpacePi (BSC) lasts until 2099, effectively transferring tokens to the black hole address permanently. The locking contract is provided by the well-known locking platform dx.app, ensuring security and reliability.\n\nThe actual supply of SpacePi (BSC) is calculated using a floating method, equal to the total token amount - the total locked tokens - the tokens locked in LP. The actual circulating supply fluctuates around 1000000B.\n\nIn the future, burning methods will be adopted to reduce the circulating supply of SpacePi (BSC).\n\nThe SpacePi Foundation hereby commits that after the official launch of the Pi Network, there will be no consideration of changing the total amount of SpacePi (BSC) when it migrates to the Pi mainnet. Meanwhile, the tech team of SpacePi (BSC) no longer holds any tokens, and the SpacePi (BSC) official website will be open-sourced at the appropriate time, transitioning to full decentralization managed entirely by the community.'
